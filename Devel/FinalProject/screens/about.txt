                                     About

   This program was created by Lee Brown as his final project for his
   CIS210 course at Manchester Community College.  It is meant to help
   showcase the various small and large programs that he created in
                   this class during the fall 2020 semester.

  Instructions for each part of this program are provided on the introductory
  screen of that particular selection, and guidance is placed throughout most
    parts of the app in order to ensure a consistently positive experience.

    If you would like to contact Lee about this program, you can send him an
   email at lbrown565@students.ccsnh.edu.  Make sure to put 'CIS210 Showcase
                           App' in the email title.
